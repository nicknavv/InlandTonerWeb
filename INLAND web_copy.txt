INLAND Toner is a family owned business that specializes in providing customers with efficient, quality, and eco-friendly remanufactured toner cartridges. We use OEM cartridges from manufacturers such as Dell, HP, Canon, Brother, and Lexmark.

WHAT WE DO:
 
We offer a cost effective alternative to buying retail and our products are manufactured in the USA in facilities with ISO 9000 and STMC certifications which means that we have standardized processes in place to manufacture, test and facilitate continuous improvement of our toner cartridges

(Certification)

ISO9001:
ISO 9000 is a family of standards for quality management systems. Some of the requirements in the ISO 9001 standard include: documenting procedures, monitoring processes, keeping adequate records, taking corrective action, regularly reviewing the overall system and facilitating continuous improvement.

STMC:
STMC stands for the Standardized Test Methods Committee. This global committee formed to find and promote standardized test methods for the printer cartridge industry. The test methods are used to evaluate toner printer cartridge performance. Standardized test methods make it possible to evaluate a cartridge anywhere and come up with the same test results no matter who tests it.

ISO 19752
The ISO 19752 standard is a standardized page yield test for monochrome (b/w) laser printer cartridges. The test is done with a minimum of nine cartridges tested on three separate printers with a standard print/test page under specific environmental conditions and printer settings.

ISO 19798
The ISO 19798 standard is a standardized page yield test for color laser printer cartridges. The test is done with a minimum of 12 cartridges(three sets of CMYK) tested on three separate printers with a standard set of five different print/test pages under specific environmental conditions and default printer settings.

(FAQ)

Q: Why use Inland Toner vs. an original retail cartridge or compatible remanufactured with other companies?
A: Using products from Inland Toner can save you $500-$1000 per year on printing costs (depending on how much you print). We use the same cartridge that you would get when purchasing retail – the only difference is that it is remanufactured here in the U.S. and the price you pay is lower than the retail product. In addition, all of our cartridges are remanufactured in a facility that is ISO 9000 certified and STMC compliant. Please see the Certifications tab for more detailed information.  It is important to note that most companies that remanufacture DO NOT have all of these certifications so make sure you know who you are buying from.

 

Q: Does Inland Toner use original cores from manufacturers such as HP, Brother, Canon , etc?

A: Yes, we remanufacture original cores. In addition, we have a selection of compatible toner for those models that we are not yet able to remanufacture using OEM components.

 

Q: Will using your cartridge void the warranty on my printer?

A: No.  The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act ensures that as long as you use the printer/copier in the manner for which it was intended, you are free to use whatever product or brand of toner or ink cartridge that you believe to be suitable for your intended purpose.

 

Q: What type of toner do you provide?

A: Inland Toner provides toner cartridges for color and monochrome laser, MICR, fax and multi-function printers as well as copiers.

 

Q: Is my cartridge guaranteed to work?

A: Yes. Our toner is 100% guaranteed. If you encounter an issue with our toner, please contact us. Before returning a cartridge, please check your printer’s components as sometimes the failure is with the printer and not the toner cartridge.

 

Q: What if I don’t see my toner listed on your website, does that mean you don’t carry it?

A: Because we carry a large selection of toner, everything may not be listed on our website, especially newer models. So if you don’t see your toner listed, please email us at support@inlandtoner.com and we will double check for you.
